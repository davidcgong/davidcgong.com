Hey! I'm a former pro table tennis athlete currently studying computer science at [Georgia Tech](https://gatech.edu). My interests in the field lie primarily in machine learning, data science, and full stack product development.

In my free time, I love to conduct research on the quantitative side of investing for the stock market, play table tennis, do options trading, and working on a couple of entrepreneurial ventures.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, please e-mail me at [davidcgong@gatech.edu](mailto:davidcgong@gatech.edu)!
