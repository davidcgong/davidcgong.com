Hi! I'm a former pro table tennis athlete currently studying computer science at [Georgia Tech](https://gatech.edu). My interests in the field lie primarily in mobile application development (Android), full stack web development, and machine learning.

I have done software engineering internships in the past with [PlayStation](https://playstation.com) and [Siemens](https://siemens.com), and will be joining [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) this fall semester.

Some things I enjoy outside of making software:
- Table tennis 🏓 + basketball 🏀 + ice skating ⛸️ <= I try not to fall more than once every 3 seconds
- Stock investing 📈 (quantitative + discretionary)
- Movies + dramas 🎥
- Beat making 🎶
- "Entrepreneurship" 💡
