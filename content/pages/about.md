Hi there! Thanks for coming to my website.

I graduated from Georgia Tech in May 2020 and will be working at LinkedIn post June as a new grad software engineer.

I previously held internships at LinkedIn, PlayStation, and Siemens.

What I do/did in my free time:
- Table tennis (I was formerly a top 1, top 4, and top 10 ranked junior athlete in the United States)
- Investing (quantitative + discretionary) 
- Work on side ideas from time to time 

## Free resume reviews (no strings attached)

I'm also providing tips and advice for people who are college students. If you'd like me to take a look at your resume or have any questions, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn (make sure you write a note so I know that you've been here) or email me at <a href="mailto:davidcgong@gmail.com">davidcgong@gmail.com</a>. 

I'm doing this for free with no strings attached, though depending on how busy I am I may not be able to get back to you quickly.
