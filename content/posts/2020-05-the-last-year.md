Since my last post, I was fortunate enough to complete a couple of internships at LinkedIn and PlayStation and graduate from Georgia Tech. That pretty much sums it up, along with lots of great memories. Suffice to say the least, it's been one wild ride, from COVID-19 impacting the economy, to graduating virtually from one of the top engineering institutes in the nation.

As much as I didn't like the assignments and all-nighters I had to pull for assignments and exams, I'm starting to feel a bit of Stockholm Syndrome creep into my system. I'm going to inevitably miss the school experience, where I was surrounded by friends and peers whom were of my own age. I do feel that now, I have entered a completely new stage in life. It's exciting, of course, in a different way.

I haven't quite planned out what my plans are for now, but here's a list of what I have planned next, taking into account that I will be invested in my full time job at LinkedIn.

## Hobbies

### Participating in coding competitions (Google Kickstart, Code Jam, USACO past questions)
I have to admit, the prospect of doing coding competitions wasn't really there for me in the beginning. After all, it took me a good two years to finally develop a solid fundamentals with regards to computer science, specifically data structures & algorithms. 

However, after taking several advanced level algorithm courses and potentially expanding on it more with potential part-time graduate school prospects, I thought why not seek to learn what I know about dynamic programming, graph algorithms, computational mathematics, and many more to work? That leads into the second topic. I'm also missing a bit of the old days when I used to go to math competitions in high school.

### Exploring new sports and adventures
I've always shared a deep love for adventuring and travelling in different places around the world. I'll finally be able to finance a lot of these trips myself rather than saving money, though of course thanks to COVID-19 my post-graduate plans were cancelled :(

I used to also be a pretty competitive table tennis player in the United States. I'm looking to turn a new leaf and explore other sports such as basketball, swimming, rock climbing, and more. I can definitively say I'm probably burned out from dedicating a ton of my life towards table tennis, lol.

## Education

### Do an online master's in computer science while working
I've thought about it a great deal, and I realized that pursuing additional knowledge and challenging myself was actually pretty cool. In particular, I really enjoyed the A.I. curriculum I did during my undergraduate years at GT, namely Deep Learning and Machine Learning. Even though they were graduate level courses, I really enjoyed the rigor to which you got to dive into a topic and understand it. While I may have gained some knowledge of the basics, I think it would be cool to further apply and expand upon this knowledge.

Instead of OMSCS at Georgia Tech, I'm looking at several other much more options such as UIUC, Johns Hopkins, USC, UCLA, and Columbia. I'm doing this mainly because I want some diversity in my education - plus there is tuition reimbursement to offset a good portion of the cost.

 If I do decide to go this route, I plan to take it slow, probably only 1 class maximum per semester. I think doing anymore is a quick recipe for burnout, and I'm mostly looking to further gain knowledge in addition to getting a master's degree.

## Side projects
### Algorithmic trading
As you may have gathered from my blog, I do have somewhat of an interest in creating algorithms for automated trading. I plan to further develop several algorithms that can:

- Automate day trading through utilizing float, volume, and various other indicators
- Actively rebalance a portfolio by assessing risk / reward with ranking of individual tickers
- Deep reinforcement learning for trading stocks and cryptocurrency
- Hm. Want to let me know about more ideas in the Disqus comments below? :-)

### Portfolio management site
I plan to create through many small iterations an automated portfolio manager that is good and free for all to use and see, similarly to Wealthfront, Betterment, Vise, and various other platforms. Hopefully, this includes intelligent backtesting and financial models and equations to help people understand what exactly constitutes a great portfolio and the criteria needed to select top winning stocks.

### Some software that provides a different service
I'm definitely beating the dead horse on doing software for finance themed projects. I'm still casually doing research on potential software projects that can disrupt and overall contribute to the betterment of society. I've been looking at ideas related to mobile app / game development, live video streaming, VR, AR as of most recently.

## Conclusion
That about covers it. I'm looking forward to the surprises and twists that the futures might have in store for me :)
