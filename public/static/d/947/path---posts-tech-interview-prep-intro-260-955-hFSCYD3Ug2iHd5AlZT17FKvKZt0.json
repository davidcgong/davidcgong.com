Often times, they require in-depth knowledge of data structures &#x26; algorithms, and how to apply them. You will encounter various scenarios in the workplace where you may need to utilize these fundamentals efficiently to build scalable code and processes.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, though universities often teach about the fundamentals and implementations of basic data structures &#x26; algorithms, they seldom teach these students how to apply these concepts to solve problems that are encountered in interviews.</p>\n<p>I’ll cover some popular problems in each of the subcategory in later posts for these series, but the main focus for the introduction is to talk briefly about two things.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How to get an interview in the first place</li>\n<li>Study methodologies for the coding interview</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"resume\"><a href=\"#resume\" aria-label=\"resume permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Resume</h2>\n<p>The good old resume. I</p>\n <!-- If you're more concerned about learning how to get interviews over the soft introduction to a coding interview example, click <a href=\"\">here</a>.\n\n## Soft intro to a coding interview example (Easy)\n\nAs an example, let's start with probably one of the easier questions you might see.\n\n### Two Sum\n>Given an array of integers and a target sum, find two numbers within the array that add up to the target sum, and return the indices of these two integers.\n\nFor any interview question, even one on the easier side such as this, interviewers want to see two things.\n1. You can optimize / communicate both the time complexity and space complexity as well as tradeoffs if there are any.\n2. You know how to code without much syntax issues.\n\nFor someone that is completely new to the coding interview process, they may think, okay that doesn't sound so hard. Why not just look at each element in the array, and then check to see if any other elements in the array will end up resulting in the target sum if added. A naive implementation might look something like this:\n\n```cpp\nvector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\n  for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) \n    for (int j = i+1; j < nums.size(); j++) \n      if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) \n          return vector<int> {i, j};\n  return vector<int> {}; // if we didn't return in the double loop, there is no match\n}\n\n```\n\nTime complexity: $O(n^2)$\nSpace complexity : $O(1)$\n\nSince this is a brute force solution, your interviewer may be waiting to see what else you can do to make this algorithm more \"efficient\".  -->","fields":{"slug":"/posts/tech-interview-prep-intro","tagSlugs":["/tag/interview-prep/","/tag/engineering/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-05-09T09:30:08.000Z","description":"An introduction to technical interviews for target companies, in addition to criteria that recruiters are looking for when selecting interviewees.","tags":["Interview Prep","Engineering"],"title":"Preparing for technical interviews (intro)"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/tech-interview-prep-intro"}}
