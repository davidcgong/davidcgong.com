That pretty much sums it up, along with great memories along the way. But suffice to say the least, it’s been one wild ride, from COVID-19 impacting the economy, to graduating virtually from one of the top engineering institutes in the nation. I’m somewhat proud.</p>\n<p>As much as I didn’t like the assignments and all-nighters I had to pull for assignments and exams, I’m starting to feel a bit of Stockholm Syndrome creep into my system. I’m going to inevitably miss the school experience, where I was surrounded by friends and peers whom were of my own age. I do feel that now, I have entered a completely new stage in life. It’s exciting, of course, in a different way.</p>\n<p>I haven’t quite planned out what my plans are for now, but here’s a list of what I have planned next, taking into account that I will be invested in my full time job at LinkedIn.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hobbies\"><a href=\"#hobbies\" aria-label=\"hobbies permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Hobbies</h2>\n<h3 id=\"participating-in-coding-competitions-google-kickstart-code-jam-usaco-past-questions\"><a href=\"#participating-in-coding-competitions-google-kickstart-code-jam-usaco-past-questions\" aria-label=\"participating in coding competitions google kickstart code jam usaco past questions permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Participating in coding competitions (Google Kickstart, Code Jam, USACO past questions)</h3>\n<p>I have to admit, the prospect of doing coding competitions wasn’t really there for me in the beginning. After all, it took me a good two years to finally develop a solid fundamentals with regards to computer science, specifically data structures &#x26; algorithms. </p>\n<p>However, after taking several advanced level algorithm courses and potentially expanding on it more with potential part-time graduate school prospects, I thought why not seek to learn what I know about dynamic programming, graph algorithms, computational mathematics, and many more to work?

I’ll finally be able to finance a lot of these trips myself rather than saving money, though of course thanks to COVID-19 I won’t have more than a couple months at a time to travel - at least for a while.</p>\n<p>I used to also be a formerly top professional junior table tennis athlete in the United States. I’m looking to turn a new leaf and explore other sports such as basketball, swimming, rock climbing, and more. I can definitively say I’m probably burned out from dedicating a ton of my life towards table tennis, lol.</p>\n<h2 id=\"education\"><a href=\"#education\" aria-label=\"education permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Education</h2>\n<h3 id=\"do-an-online-masters-in-computer-science-while-working\"><a href=\"#do-an-online-masters-in-computer-science-while-working\" aria-label=\"do an online masters in computer science while working permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Do an online master’s in computer science while working</h3>\n<p>I’ve thought about it a great deal, and I realized that pursuing additional knowledge and challenging myself was actually pretty cool. In particular, I really enjoyed the A.I. curriculum I did during my undergraduate years at GT, namely Deep Learning and Machine Learning. Even though they were graduate level courses, I really enjoyed the rigor to which you got to dive into a topic and understand it. While I may have gained some knowledge of the basics, I think it would be cool to further apply and expand upon this knowledge.</p>\n<p>Instead of OMSCS at Georgia Tech, I’m looking at several other much more options such as UIUC, Johns Hopkins, USC, UCLA, and Columbia. I’m doing this mainly because I want some diversity in my education, in addition to having tuition reimbursement for higher education from my company.</p>\n<p> I plan to take it slow, probably only 1 class maximum per semester. I think doing anymore is a quick recipe for burnout, and I’m mostly looking to further gain knowledge in addition to getting a master’s degree.</p>\n<h2 id=\"side-projects\"><a href=\"#side-projects\" aria-label=\"side projects permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Side projects</h2>\n<h3 id=\"algorithmic-trading\"><a href=\"#algorithmic-trading\" aria-label=\"algorithmic trading permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Algorithmic trading</h3>\n<p>As you may have gathered from my blog, I do have somewhat of an interest in creating algorithms for automated trading.
