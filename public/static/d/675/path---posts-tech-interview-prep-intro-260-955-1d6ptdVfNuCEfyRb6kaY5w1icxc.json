Often times, they require in-depth knowledge of data structures &#x26; algorithms, and how to apply them. You will encounter various scenarios in the workplace where you may need to utilize these fundamentals efficiently to build scalable code and processes.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, though universities often teach about the fundamentals and implementations of basic data structures &#x26; algorithms, they seldom teach these students how to apply these concepts to solve problems that are encountered in interviews.</p>\n<p>I’ll cover some popular problems in each of the subcategory in later posts for these series, but the main focus for the introduction is to talk briefly about two things.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How to get an interview in the first place</li>\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n<p> If you’re more concerned about learning how to get interviews over the soft introduction to a coding interview example, click <a href=\"\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"soft-intro-to-a-coding-interview-example-easy\"><a href=\"#soft-intro-to-a-coding-interview-example-easy\" aria-label=\"soft intro to a coding interview example easy permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Soft intro to a coding interview example (Easy)</h2>\n<p>As an example, let’s start with probably one of the easier questions you might see.</p>\n<h3 id=\"two-sum\"><a href=\"#two-sum\" aria-label=\"two sum permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Two Sum</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Given an array of integers and a target sum, find two numbers within the array that add up to the target sum, and return the indices of these two integers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For any interview question, even one on the easier side such as this, interviewers want to see two things.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can optimize / communicate both the time complexity and space complexity as well as tradeoffs if there are any.</li>\n<li>You know how to code without much syntax issues.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For someone that is completely new to the coding interview process, they may think, okay that doesn’t sound so hard.
